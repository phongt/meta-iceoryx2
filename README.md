# meta-yocto-iceoryx2

Yocto Layer for Eclipse iceoryx2â„¢

## Manual setup

### Prerequisites

This setup is based on Ubuntu 24.04.

If you are running in a docker environment with a minimal Ubuntu setup,
ensure that a timezone is set before running the other commands. One option
to succeed with this is:

```sh
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tzdata
```

Before we start with the Yocto build, ensure that the following dependencies 
are installed:

```sh
sudo apt install -y \
    chrpath \
    cpio \
    diffstat \
    file \
    gawk \
    gcc \
    git \
    language-pack-en \
    lz4 \
    pip \
    python3 \
    wget \
    zstd
```

### Setup the Yocto build

Move to your project directory and checkout the Poky distribution and switch to the `scarthgap` branch:

```sh
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky --branch scarthgap
cd poky
```

Now source the `oe-init-build-env` and build the base system.

```sh
source oe-init-build-env
```

This will also change the location to the build directory. If you don't want
to have the build directory inside the `poky` source checkout, you can pass a
path to `oe-init-build-env`.

Since Yocto can consume quite a lot of disk space, we add
`INHERIT += "rm_work"` to `conf/local.conf`.

```sh
echo 'INHERIT += "rm_work"' >> conf/local.conf
```

Now it's time to build the base image. This can take quite some time.

```sh
bitbake core-image-base
```

### Build iceoryx2-image-full

In order to build iceoryx2, we need to add more dependencies. Navigate to the
`poky` directory, clone `meta-openenbedded`, `meta-rust-bin` and `meta-iceoryx2` and add the layers to `conf/bblayers.conf`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git --branch scarthgap
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-openembedded/meta-oe

git clone https://github.com/rust-embedded/meta-rust-bin.git
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-rust-bin

git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/meta-iceoryx2.git
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-iceoryx2
```

The `meta-oe` layer is needed in order to build the tests with gTest and
the `meta-iceoryx2-bin` layer is required to build iceoryx2 itself.

We are now ready to build the `iceoryx2-image-full`, which does not only
contain the libraries and CLI tools but also the examples and tests.

```sh
bitbake iceoryx2-image-full
```

By default, the `qemux86-64` image is build. To select a different image, just
uncomment the desired platform from the `Machine Selection`.

Once the build process completes, the image can be used with the
`runqemu qemux86-64` command.


### Run an iceoryx2 example

The examples are located under `/usr/bin/iceoryx2/examples`, with `rust`, `c` and `cxx` subfolders.

When qemu is used to run the image, the user needs to login with `root` and no
password. Once logged in, the following command can be used to run the
publish-subscribe examples.

```sh
/usr/bin/iceoryx2/examples/rust/publish_subscribe_subscriber &
/usr/bin/iceoryx2/examples/rust/publish_subscribe_publisher
```

On the terminal, the output of the applications should now appear.

When the publisher is stopped, the iceoryx2 CLI can be used to list the
information from the still running subscriber example.

```sh
iox2 node list
iox2 service list
```

These command will list the available information about the iceoryx2 application.

## How to build iceoryx2-image-full with kas

```sh
mkdir yocto-iceoryx2
cd yocto-iceoryx2
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install kas
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/meta-iceoryx2.git
```

- build with yocto kirkstone - machine=qemux86-64

```sh
kas build meta-iceoryx2/kas/kirkstone.yml
```

- build with yocto scarthgap - machine=qemux86-64

```sh
kas build meta-iceoryx2/kas/scarthgap.yml
```
